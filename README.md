Rework of Kaputtpanzers 6HP eurorack AR module. My version shaves off 2HP and combines the originals LED and button into one unit. 
This version uses 0402 components and is very cheap to get assembled at jlcpcb as all the parts are from the basic component range. I havn't use the exact assembly files posted here, so double check them if you intend to use them.
It's not really suited for hand soldering due to the tiny pitch of 0402.

Module is fully tested and working, No further revision are planned.
